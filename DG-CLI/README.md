# DG::CLI

This gem is to assist in determining the best disc golf course to play near you based on a few criteria.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'DG-CLI'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install DG-CLI

## Usage

within your IRB environment, choose your level of importance for the three criteria (distance from you, overall course length, and course difficulty) to return a top five list of courses for you based on your answers. Can be zip code based or not, however it will prompt for a zip code regardless.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
